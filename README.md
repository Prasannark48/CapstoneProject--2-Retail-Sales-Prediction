# CapstoneProject--2-Retail-Sales-Prediction

Sales forecasting is the process of estimating future sales. Accurate sales forecasts enable companies to make informed business decisions and predict short-term and long-term performance. Companies can base their forecasts on past sales data, industry-wide comparisons, and economic trends. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of sales records, we will be predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied and the task is to forecast the “Sales” column. 

Dirk Rossmann GmbH (Rossmann) is a private, German drug store chain founded in 1972 and is a key player in the European pharmacy market, with operations in healthcare and beauty retail industries. According to Bloomberg, Rossmann offers a wide range of products including baby and body care, hygiene, sun protection, cosmetics, dental hygiene, household, pets, hair care, perfume, fragrances, and food products.

we are provided with historical sales data for 1,115 Rossmann stores. The task is to forecast the "Sales" column for the test set. Noting that some stores in the dataset were temporarily closed for refurbishment. Our experiment can help understand what could be the reason for the regression of such labels by feature selection, data analysis and prediction with machine learning algorithms taking into account previous trends to determine the correct Regression models.
First, I performed data cleaning for the raw data. Asking right question to dataset is always considered as great approach so I asked some very meaningful questions and plotted graphs and other visualization entities to get insights from data.

Next, we implemented 7 machine learning algorithms Linear Regression,lasso,ridge,elasticnet,decission tree, Random Forest and GradientBoosting. We did hyperparameter tuning to improve our model performance.
